## Vercel Web Analytics Configuration - Already Implemented

### Summary
Upon inspection, Vercel Web Analytics was **already properly installed and configured** in this Next.js App Router project. No code changes were necessary.

### Current State
**Installation:**
- Package: `@vercel/analytics@1.6.1` (already in package.json)
- Installed successfully via `npm install`

**Configuration:**
- Location: `src/app/layout.tsx` (App Router root layout)
- Import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- Component placement: Inside `<body>` tag, after `{children}` wrapped in `<ThemeProvider>`

### Implementation Details
The Analytics component is correctly positioned in the root layout:
```tsx
<body>
  <ThemeProvider>
    {children}
  </ThemeProvider>
  <Analytics />
</body>
```

This follows Vercel's recommended pattern for App Router projects.

### Verification Steps Completed
1. ✅ Confirmed `@vercel/analytics@1.6.1` is in package.json
2. ✅ Installed dependencies using `npm install`
3. ✅ Verified Analytics import and component in layout.tsx
4. ✅ Built project successfully with `npm run build`
5. ✅ All 9 routes compiled and generated successfully
6. ✅ Ran linter - pre-existing errors unrelated to Analytics integration

### Files Updated
- `package-lock.json` - Updated during dependency installation (npm removed peer flags)

### Notes
- No code changes were required as the implementation was already complete and correct
- The build passes successfully
- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and Web Vitals when deployed to Vercel
- Pre-existing linting errors exist in the codebase but are unrelated to Analytics configuration
